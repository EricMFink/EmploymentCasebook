### Karen Orren, Belated Feudalism: The Order of the Workplace in Late-Nineteenth Century America

[W]hen the United Stated embarked upon full-scale industrialization in the decades following the Civil War, American labor relations were a remnant of the ancient order, in the sense that arrangement established in England in previous centuries were carried forward and enforced in law, often with only slight modification, to form the framework of relations between American employers and their employees. [ ... ]

[C]ertain considerations should be understood as fundamental. The  first is that employment relations, being a vestige of the old order, were still goverened by the judiciary. As a consequence, historical continuity will be observed in the ancient precedents usd by judges to decide disputes between employers and employees, and sometimes also third parties, who came before the American courts. [...] [I]n this chapter I discuss the substance of governance, including the *prescriptive* nature of the common law, the enforcement of rules existing a priori, in contrast to the voluntary principles associated with the modern idea of contract. In fact, wage workers had traditionally wored, or "served," under contracts, but for the vast majorityh those were what are known as implied contracts, rather than express contracts, the contents of implied contracts being predetermined and legally assumed to have been agreed to by the parties upon the act of hiring. On those occasions when express contracts were entered into, as with respect to the specific time or job for which the contract was to run, courts also interpreted their provisions in light of the older rules. In other words, in settling labor disputes that came before them, the judges were imposing a long-established structure of relations upon employer and employee, not arbitrating between two parties who had entered, de novo as in contract theory, into an agreement.

#### The Order of Labor 

At the most abstract level, "feudal" refers to the fact that the hierachical relation of master and servant in nineteenth-century America was a remnant of the larger system of hirarchies that historically had extended up and down medieval society. [ ... ] 

[L]aborers in the Middle Ages were an order in society in three aspects: Laborers were participants in the specific hierarchy of master and servant. They occupied a designated status within society at large. And, as both of those, laborers were an incorporation of the larger moral system of being and acting that was the reason of social existence. Although certain details would change, those aspects continued to characterize labor regulation in the late nineteenth century. The rules of the workplace, the material requirements of society, the civilization of legality---each reacted upon the others, coloring and intensifying and justifying the others.

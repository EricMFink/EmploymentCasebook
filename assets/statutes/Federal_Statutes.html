19, 20, or 24 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, or over claims by
persons proposed to be joined as plaintiffs under Rule 19 of such rules,

<h2>Removal</h2>
<section id="removal-of-civil-actions" class="level3">
<h3>§ 1441. Removal of civil actions</h3>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Generally.— Except as otherwise expressly provided by Act of
Congress, any civil action brought in a State court of which the
district courts of the United States have original jurisdiction, may be
removed by the defendant or the defendants, to the district court of the
United States for the district and division embracing the place where
such action is pending.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Removal Based on Diversity of Citizenship.—</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>In determining whether a civil action is removable on the basis of
the jurisdiction under section 1332(a) of this title, the citizenship of
defendants sued under fictitious names shall be disregarded.</li>
<li>A civil action otherwise removable solely on the basis of the
jurisdiction under section 1332(a) of this title may not be removed if
any of the parties in interest properly joined and served as defendants
is a citizen of the State in which such action is brought.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Joinder of Federal law claims and State law claims.—</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>If a civil action includes—
<ol type="A">
<li>a claim arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the
United States (within the meaning of section 1331 of this title),
and</li>
<li>a claim not within the original or supplemental jurisdiction of the
district court or a claim that has been made nonremovable by statute,
the entire action may be removed if the action would be removable
without the inclusion of the claim described in subparagraph (B).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Upon removal of an action described in paragraph (1), the district
court shall sever from the action all claims described in paragraph
(1)(B) and shall remand the severed claims to the State court from which
the action was removed. Only defendants against whom a claim described
in paragraph (1)(A) has been asserted are required to join in or consent
to the removal under paragraph (1).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>[Omitted]</p></li>
<li><p>[Omitted]</p></li>
<li><p>Derivative Removal Jurisdiction.— The court to which a civil
action is removed under this section is not precluded from hearing and
determining any claim in such civil action because the State court from
which such civil action is removed did not have jurisdiction over that
claim.</p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="procedure-for-removal-of-civil-actions" class="level3">
<h3>§ 1446. Procedure for removal of civil actions</h3>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Generally.— A defendant or defendants desiring to remove any
civil action from a State court shall file in the district court of the
United States for the district and division within which such action is
pending a notice of removal signed pursuant to Rule 11 of the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure and containing a short and plain statement of
the grounds for removal, together with a copy of all process, pleadings,
and orders served upon such defendant or defendants in such
action.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Requirements; Generally.—</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The notice of removal of a civil action or proceeding shall be filed
within 30 days after the receipt by the defendant, through service or
otherwise, of a copy of the initial pleading setting forth the claim for
relief upon which such action or proceeding is based, or within 30 days
after the service of summons upon the defendant if such initial pleading
has then been filed in court and is not required to be served on the
defendant, whichever period is shorter.</li>
<li><ol type="A">
<li>When a civil action is removed solely under section 1441(a), all
defendants who have been properly joined and served must join in or
consent to the removal of the action.</li>
<li>Each defendant shall have 30 days after receipt by or service on
that defendant of the initial pleading or summons described in paragraph
(1) to file the notice of removal.</li>
<li>If defendants are served at different times, and a later-served
defendant files a notice of removal, any earlier-served defendant may
consent to the removal even though that earlier-served defendant did not
previously initiate or consent to removal.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Except as provided in subsection (c), if the case stated by the
initial pleading is not removable, a notice of removal may be filed
within thirty days after receipt by the defendant, through service or
otherwise, of a copy of an amended pleading, motion, order or other
paper from which it may first be ascertained that the case is one which
is or has become removable.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requirements; Removal Based on Diversity of Citizenship.—</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A case may not be removed under subsection (b)(3) on the basis of
jurisdiction conferred by section 1332 more than 1 year after
commencement of the action, unless the district court finds that the
plaintiff has acted in bad faith in order to prevent a defendant from
removing the action.</li>
<li>If removal of a civil action is sought on the basis of the
jurisdiction conferred by section 1332(a), the sum demanded in good
faith in the initial pleading shall be deemed to be the amount in
controversy, except that—
<ol type="A">
<li>the notice of removal may assert the amount in controversy if the
initial pleading seeks—
<ol type="i">
<li>nonmonetary relief; or</li>
<li>a money judgment, but the State practice either does not permit
demand for a specific sum or permits recovery of damages in excess of
the amount demanded; and</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>removal of the action is proper on the basis of an amount in
controversy asserted under subparagraph (A) if the district court finds,
by the preponderance of the evidence, that the amount in controversy
exceeds the amount specified in section 1332(a).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><ol type="A">
<li>If the case stated by the initial pleading is not removable solely
because the amount in controversy does not exceed the amount specified
in section 1332(a), information relating to the amount in controversy in
the record of the State proceeding, or in responses to discovery, shall
be treated as an “other paper” under subsection (b)(3).</li>
<li>If the notice of removal is filed more than 1 year after
commencement of the action and the district court finds that the
plaintiff deliberately failed to disclose the actual amount in
controversy to prevent removal, that finding shall be deemed bad faith
under paragraph (1).</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Notice to Adverse Parties and Court.— Promptly after the filing
of such notice of removal of a civil action the defendant or defendants
shall give written notice thereof to all adverse parties and shall file
a copy of the notice with the clerk of such State court, which shall
effect the removal and the State court shall proceed no further unless
and until the case is remanded.</p></li>
<li><p>[Omitted]</p></li>
<li><p> [Omitted]</p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="procedure-after-removal-generally" class="level3">
<h3>§ 1447. Procedure after removal generally</h3>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>In any case removed from a State court, the district court may
issue all necessary orders and process to bring before it all proper
parties whether served by process issued by the State court or
otherwise.</p></li>
<li><p>It may require the removing party to file with its clerk copies
of all records and proceedings in such State court or may cause the same
to be brought before it by writ of certiorari issued to such State
court.</p></li>
<li><p>A motion to remand the case on the basis of any defect other than
lack of subject matter jurisdiction must be made within 30 days after
the filing of the notice of removal under section 1446(a). If at any
time before final judgment it appears that the district court lacks
subject matter jurisdiction, the case shall be remanded. An order
remanding the case may require payment of just costs and any actual
expenses, including attorney fees, incurred as a result of the removal.
A certified copy of the order of remand shall be mailed by the clerk to
the clerk of the State court. The State court may thereupon proceed with
such case.</p></li>
<li><p>An order remanding a case to the State court from which it was
removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise, except that an order
remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed pursuant
to section 1442 or 1443 of this title shall be reviewable by appeal or
otherwise.</p></li>
<li><p>If after removal the plaintiff seeks to join additional
defendants whose joinder would destroy subject matter jurisdiction, the
court may deny joinder, or permit joinder and remand the action to the
State court.</p></li>

### T-Mobile USA v. NLRB

#### 865 F.3d 265 (5th Cir. 2017)

##### E. GRADY JOLLY, Circuit Judge:

In this appeal, the National Labor Relations Board ("NLRB" or "Board") challenges certain T-Mobile workplace rules, which it contends prohibit employees from exercising unionizing rights.

T-Mobile's employee handbook (1) encouraged employees to "maintain a positive work environment"; (2) prohibited "\[a\]rguing or fighting," "failing to treat others with respect," and "failing to demonstrate appropriate teamwork"; (3) prohibited all photography and audio or video recording in the workplace; and (4) prohibited access to electronic information by non-approved individuals. The Board determined that all four provisions violated the National Labor Relations Act because each of them discouraged unionizing or other concerted activity protected by the Act. T-Mobile resists and seeks review of the Board's order.

We hold that the Board erred in finding that a reasonable employee would construe policies (1), (2), and (4) to prohibit protected activity. However, we will not upset the Board's finding that a reasonable employee would construe policy (3) to prohibit protected activity. Accordingly, we grant in part and deny in part enforcement of the Board's order.

T-Mobile and MetroPCS are telecommunications companies that market cell phones and related services, with offices and retail locations located throughout the United States. In 2014, based on charges filed by the Communication Workers of America, the NLRB brought a complaint against T-Mobile alleging that several of the provisions of T-Mobile's employee handbook violated the National Labor Relations Act ("NLRA"), 29 U.S.C. § 151 _et seq._ This appeal concerns four provisions of the handbook that the NLRB determined were forbidden under the NLRA.

###### A.

The "workplace conduct" policy is found under the "Standards of Conduct" heading in the employee handbook. The policy provides:

> \[T-Mobile\] expects all employees to behave in a professional manner that promotes efficiency, productivity, and cooperation. Employees are expected to maintain a positive work environment by communicating in a manner that is conducive to effective working relationships with internal and external customers, clients, co-workers, and management.

The "commitment-to-integrity" policy is found under the "Conducting Business" heading in the code of business conduct. The policy begins with the preface:

> At T-Mobile, we expect all employees, officers and directors to exercise integrity, common sense, good judgment, and to act in a professional manner. We do not tolerate inconsistent conduct. While we cannot anticipate every situation that might arise or list all possible violations, the acts listed below are unacceptable.

The commitment-to-integrity policy then lists seventeen non-inclusive examples of "unacceptable" acts, including, in relevant part:

> Arguing or fighting with co-workers, subordinates or supervisors; failing to treat others with respect; or failing to demonstrate appropriate teamwork.

The "recording" policy is found under the "Workplace Expectations" heading of the employee handbook. The policy provides:

> To prevent harassment, maintain individual privacy, encourage open communication, and protect confidential information employees are prohibited from recording people or confidential information using cameras, camera phones/devices, or recording devices (audio or video) in the workplace. Apart from customer calls that are recorded for quality purposes, employees may not tape or otherwise make sound recordings of work-related or workplace discussions. Exceptions may be granted when participating in an authorized \[T-Mobile\] activity or with permission from an employee's Manager, HR Business Partner, or the Legal Department. If an exception is granted, employees may not take a picture, audiotape, or videotape others in the workplace without the prior notification of all participants.

Finally, the "acceptable use" policy is found under the "Security" heading of T-Mobile's "Acceptable Use Policy for Information and Communication Resources." The policy provides:

> Users may not permit non-approved individuals access to information or information resources, or any information transmitted by, received from, printed from, or stored in these resources, without prior written approval from an authorized T-Mobile representative.

\[The NLRB held that the challenged policies violated the NLRA. T-Mobile appealed.\]

##### II.

###### A.

Section 7 of the NLRA provides a declaration of statutory policy: "\[e\]mployees shall have the right to self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection." Section 8(a)(1) of the Act in turn provides enforcement of that policy by stating that it shall be an "unfair labor practice" to "interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of the rights" protected by Section 7. Here, the "appropriate inquiry" is whether T-Mobile's rules for workplace conduct violate § 8(a)(1) by chilling a reasonable employee in the exercise of his or her Section 7 rights. Indeed, our precedent has previously noted that "\[w\]here the rules are likely to have a chilling effect, the Board may conclude that their maintenance is an unfair labor practice, even absent evidence of enforcement."

In order to determine whether a workplace rule violates Section 8(a)(1), this Court applies the two-part _Lutheran Heritage_ framework. First, the Court decides "whether the rule _explicitly_ restricts activities protected by Section 7." Second, even if the restriction is not explicit, the rule may still violate Section 8(a)(1) where "(1) employees would reasonably construe the language to prohibit Section 7 activity; (2) the rule was promulgated in response to union activity; or (3) the rule has been applied to restrict the exercise of Section 7 rights." When construing a work rule, the Board must "give the rule a reasonable reading." Additionally, the Board "must refrain from reading particular phrases in isolation" and "must not presume improper interference with employee rights." The appropriate, objective inquiry is not whether the rules "_could_ conceivably be read to cover Section 7 activity, even though that reading is unreasonable," but rather whether "a reasonable employee reading the\[\] rules _would_ . . . construe them to prohibit conduct protected by the Act."

The "reasonable employee," although not specifically defined in _Lutheran Heritage_ or subsequent jurisprudence, refers to a hypothetical, objective standard analogous to the "reasonable person" in tort law. In this case, where the record does not suggest that the rules have been applied in the context of union or collective activity, the "reasonable employee" is a T-Mobile employee aware of his legal rights but who also interprets work rules as they apply to the everydayness of his job. The reasonable employee does not view every employer policy through the prism of the NLRA. Indeed, "\[the Board\] must not presume improper interference with employee rights." The question is whether a reasonable T-Mobile employee "would _reasonably construe_ the language to prohibit Section 7 activity." 

##### III.

The NLRB found that each of the four policies at issue—the workplace conduct policy, the commitment-to-integrity policy, the recording policy, and the acceptable use policy—violated the Act because "employees would reasonably construe the language to prohibit Section 7 activity." We address each policy in turn.

###### A.

We first address the workplace conduct policy. The Board found that the workplace conduct policy, which encouraged employees to maintain a "positive work environment," violated the NLRA because a reasonable employee would read the language to discourage protected activity, including candid, potentially contentious discussions of unionizing. This finding is unreasonable.

To a "reasonable employee," context matters in the interpretation of these rules. The policy is titled "_Workplace_ Conduct." The rule refers to a positive _work environment_ and effective _working relationships,_ and requires employees to behave in a way that "promotes efficiency, productivity, and cooperation," with the obvious implication "with respect to work." In the context of the workplace presented in the record, this rule addresses a normal workplace, on a normal workday.

A reasonable employee of T-Mobile would interpret the policy as requiring professional manners, positive work environment, effective and courteous communications, getting along with everybody, common sense, and people skills. The reasonable T-Mobile employee would understand the rule to express a universally accepted guide for conduct in a responsible workplace. Indeed, the Board itself admonishes that these rules must be given a "reasonable reading." In other words, the NLRB erred by interpreting the rule as to how the reasonable employee _could,_ rather than _would,_ interpret these policies—an analysis eschewed by the Board's own precedent.

This reading of these workplace rules is consistent with the only other circuit to have spoken on the matter. The DC Circuit in _Adtranz ABB Daimler-Benz Transportation, N.A., Inc. v. NLRB,_ 253 F.3d 19 (D.C. Cir. 2001), addressed a policy similar to the ones at issue. There, asserting expected conduct from employees such as "\[t\]rust and respect for self and others," "\[t\]eamwork and cooperation," and "\[e\]ffective communication," the company prohibited "abusive or threatening language to anyone on company premises." The NLRB had declared this rule in violation of the NLRA on the grounds that it prohibited an employee from engaging in heated labor discussions. The DC Circuit did not buy in: "This position is not 'reasonably defensible.' It is not even close." The court further rejected the NLRB's argument that the company's "effort to maintain a civil and decent workplace is an unfair labor practice that threatens the statutory rights of \[its\] employees under the NLRA." The DC Circuit was in no mood for temporizing, saying that "it is preposterous that employees are incapable of organizing a union or exercising their other statutory rights under the NLRA without resort to abusive or threatening language."

Still further, in _Community Hospitals of Central California v. NLRB,_ 335 F.3d 1079 (D.C. Cir. 2003), the DC Circuit continued to reject the Board's displacement of facially-neutral work rules. The court held that a rule prohibiting "insubordination. . . or other disrespectful conduct," "read in context," "applies to incivility and outright insubordination, in whatever context it occurs." Furthermore, it held, such a rule would not restrict protected activity, including "vigorous proselytizing for or against a union." 

In sum, we conclude that a reasonable employee would not construe a requirement to "maintain a positive work environment by communicating in a manner that is conducive to effective working relationships" to restrict Section 7 activity. We therefore deny enforcement of the Board's order as to the workplace conduct policy.

###### B.

The Board also found that the commitment-to-integrity policy violated the NLRA because the policy would inhibit robust discussion of labor issues. The rule, like the workplace conduct rule, is on its face, only a common sense civility guideline. 

The policy, which prohibits "arguing or fighting," "failing to treat others with respect," and "failing to demonstrate appropriate teamwork," is prefaced by the conventional, common-sense admonition that T-Mobile expects its employees to "to exercise integrity, common sense, good judgment, and to act in a professional manner." These acts appear in a long, non-inclusive list of prohibited activity, including theft, fraud, dishonesty, and sleeping on the job. These examples that define the parameters of the rule address misconduct. As the DC Circuit noted in addressing such a rule, "\[a\]lthough \[reasonable\] employees are perhaps unlikely to know the term _ejusdem generis,_ they no doubt grasp as well as anyone the concept it encapsulates." 

Here, a reasonable employee would understand the language of the commitment-to-integrity policy to refer to similar misconduct. Furthermore, a reasonable employee would be fully capable of engaging in debate over union activity or working conditions, even vigorous or heated debate, without inappropriately "arguing or fighting," "failing to treat others with respect," or "failing to demonstrate appropriate teamwork." As the Board delineated in _Lutheran Heritage,_ we view the rule from the perspective of the reasonable employee, not from the point of view of the exceptions to reasonableness.

Accordingly, we decline to enforce the Board's order as to the commitment-to-integrity policy.

###### C.

The Board next found that T-Mobile's recording policy  violates the NLRA because it would discourage workers from engaging in protected activity.

We are primarily concerned with the broad reach of the recording ban. The ban, by its plain language, encompasses any and all photography or recording on corporate premises at any time without permission from a supervisor. This ban is, by its own terms alone, stated so broadly that a reasonable employee, generally aware of employee rights, would interpret it to discourage protected concerted activity, such as even an off-duty employee photographing a wage schedule posted on a corporate bulletin board. _Cf._ _Flex Frac,_ 746 F.3d at 208 ("A workplace rule that forbids the discussion of confidential wage information between employees patently violates section 8(a)(1)."); _accord Whole Foods Mkt. Grp., Inc. v. NLRB,_ 691 Fed. Appx. 49 (2d Cir. 2017) (holding that where "no-recording policies prohibited all recording without management approval, employees would reasonably construe the language to prohibit recording protected by Section 7").

T-Mobile argues that the ban's stated purposes—"\[t\]o prevent harassment, maintain individual privacy, encourage open communication, and protect confidential information"—are legitimate business interests that ordinarily would justify the ban. But merely reciting such justifications does not alter the fact that the operative language of the rule on its face prohibits protected Section 7 activity, including Section 7 activity wholly unrelated to those stated interests.

Unlike the "workplace conduct" policy and the "commitment-to-integrity" policy, the recording policy forbids certain forms of clearly protected activity. We have earlier held that held those two policies would not be interpreted by a reasonable T-Mobile employee as forbidding protected activity. By contrast, a reasonable T-Mobile employee, aware of his legal rights, would read the language of the recording policy as plainly forbidding a means of engaging in protected activity.

Because a reasonable employee would construe the recording policy to prohibit forms of protected activity, we hold that the Board's determination that the recording policy violated the NLRA is supported by a reasonable interpretation of the record. Its order will be enforced in that respect.

###### D.

Finally, the Board found that the acceptable use policy violated the NLRA because a reasonable employee would construe it to prohibit protected activity such as accessing and sharing wage and benefit information contained in his or her e-mail.

The NLRB's decision, however, disregards the context in which the acceptable use policy is to be read and understood. The "Scope" section of the acceptable use policy explicitly states that the policy "applies to all non-public T-Mobile information." Thus the policy only prohibits employees from sharing _non-public_ information.

Where a company policy prohibits the disclosure of non-public information, courts presume that a reasonable employee would not construe the policy to prohibit the disclosure of information that may be properly used in protected activity, such as wage and benefit information, so long as the policy does not explicitly state that it encompasses such information. Here, the policy does not define "non-public T-Mobile information" in a way that would lead a reasonable worker to believe that it includes protected wage and benefit information. Instead, the policy only applies to the sort of proprietary business information that an employer may properly restrict its employees from sharing out-side of the company.

Thus the NLRB's finding that a reasonable worker would construe the acceptable use policy to discourage protected activity is unreasonable, and we deny enforcement as to that part of its order.

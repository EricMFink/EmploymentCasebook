### Smith v. Manheim Remarketing, Inc. 

#### No.  5:19-CV-00086-KDB-DSC (M.D.N.C. Nov. 26, 2019)

##### David S. Cayer, United States Magistrate Judge

##### I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

Taking the facts of the Second Amended Complaint as true, Plaintiff is a fifty-four year old woman who worked for Defendants in their motor vehicle auction business for over fourteen years. She was terminated in February 2019. At the time of her termination, Plaintiff was a Total Resource Auction supervisor and managed seven employees. She was a loyal, reliable and respected employee.

During the last several years before her termination, Plaintiff developed chronic pain and related anxiety. A year before her termination, she was diagnosed with fibromyalgia and referred to a rheumatologist who put her on prescription medication. Those medications and their side effects are detailed in the Second Amended Complaint. Plaintiff was open with her supervisors about her health problems, including her medications and their side effects.

With her rheumatologist’s knowledge and agreement, Plaintiff began using CBD oil as an alternative therapy. The oil provided Plaintiff with significant pain relief, reduced her anxiety and improved her sleep without the side effects of her prescription medications. Plaintiff bought a stronger version of the same brand CBD oil, made under the same state and federal standard of 0.3% THC or less. She would take seven or eight drops at home in the morning and enjoy significant pain relief for twenty-four hours. Plaintiff was able to wean off her prescription medications completely by early February 2019.

On February 13, 2019, Plaintiff was injured at work when a windstorm blew an open truck door against her hand. She thought her thumb was broken. Plaintiff reported the injury and went to a local medical facility for treatment. Pursuant to Defendants’ drug policy related to workplace injuries, Plaintiff was required to submit to a drug screen. Plaintiff does not use illegal drugs and had tested negative throughout her employment. She was shocked to learn that she tested positive for THC at the level of 20 ng/dl and faced possible termination. The threshold level for a positive THC test under Federal Department of Transportation regulations is 50 ng/dl. Plaintiff learned that some users of CBD oil test positive for low levels of THC.

Her direct supervisor as well as the Assistant General Manager and Human Resources representative wanted Plaintiff to remain employed and urged the corporate office not to terminate her. Plaintiff provided her managers with information about the CBD oil as well as her doctor’s agreement that she take it to treat her fibromyalgia. Plaintiff also offered to discontinue the CBD oil and resume her prescription medication. Defendants’ corporate officials rejected that proposal and insisted she be terminated. Plaintiff’s appeal to the corporate office for reinstatement was denied.

On May 22, 2019, Plaintiff filed a wrongful discharge claim in Iredell County Superior Court alleging that she was terminated for using CBD oil outside of work, in violation of the public policy set forth in N.C.Gen. Stat. §95-28.2.

Defendants removed the case to this Court on July 1, 2019 and moved to dismiss Plaintiff’s \[ … \] Complaint.

##### III. DISCUSSION

###### A. Wrongful Termination for Use of Lawful Product Claim

Plaintiff alleges that Defendants terminated her employment for using a lawful product, CBD oil, outside of work in violation of the public policy of North Carolina set forth in N.C. Gen. Stat. §95-28.2. Defendants move to dismiss this claim by arguing that the THC in CBD oil remains illegal. Defendants further argue that Plaintiff was not meeting the reasonable expectations of her employer by having “high levels” of THC at work and failing to comply with their valid workplace drug policy.

In order to adequately plead a wrongful discharge claim under this Act, Plaintiff must show that: (i) she was using a lawful product, (ii) her use of that product was lawful, and (iii) Defendants’ restriction of her use did not relate to a bona fide occupational requirement reasonably related to employment activities. 

Since 2015, North Carolina has legalized “industrial hemp.” N.C. Gen. Stat. § 106-568.51.[^Smith1] This statute allows for the cultivation and sale of products made from a variety of Cannabis sativa (L.) with a THC1 concentration of not more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis, and specifically includes “seed oil” as one type of “hemp” product. The statute defines THC,(8), and legalizes “propagules” or seeds that have THC levels below the federal standards for legal THC. The Legislature also amended the list of Controlled Substances to exclude industrial hemp as legalized in N.C. Gen. Stat. § 106-568.51 from the definition of “marijuana.” 

[^Smith1]:

  {-} The NC industrial hemp statute expired in 2022. Hemp cultivation is now governed by the federal Agriculture Improvements Act of 2018, discussed in the opinion below. See N.C. Dept. of Agriculture & Consumer Services, [Hemp in North Carolina](https://www.ncagr.gov/hemp/)

The federal standards for hemp mirror North Carolina’s standards. In the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, Congress defined “hemp” as any part of the Cannabis sativa L. plant “with a delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of not more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis.” This legislation also removed “hemp” from the Schedule I definition of “marijuana” under the Controlled Substances Act. Marijuana remains a Schedule I controlled substance under 21 U.S.C. § 812(c)(c)(10). THC also remains on schedule I, “except for tetrahydrocannabinols in hemp (as defined under section 1639o of Title 7).”

Defendants argue that Plaintiff’s use of CBD oil is still unlawful under state law because THC remains a Schedule VI substance under N.C. Gen. Stat. § 90-94(2). Plaintiff argues that Defendants reading of N.C. Gen. Stat. § 90-94(2), would nullify the statutes legalizing hemp with THC of less than 0.3 percent by dry weight.

It is a well-established principle of statutory construction that statutes in pari materia [^Smith2] must be read in context with each other.  Plaintiff argues that the hemp statutes would not make sense if the THC allowed by those statutes remained illegal under § 90-94(2). And statutes specific in nature control over more general legislation. “Where one of two statutes might apply to the same situation, the statute which deals more directly and specifically with the situation controls over the statute of more general applicability.” Based upon these principles, the Court concludes that the specific legislative exceptions legalizing CBD oil derived from industrial hemp made from cannabis with 0.3% or less of THC control over the general prohibition in § 90-94(2).

[^Smith2]: 

  {-} Statutes pertaining to the same subject matter. 

Under these nearly identical state and federal provisions, the Court finds that hemp-based CBD oil made from Cannibis sativa L. containing less than 0.3% THC by dry weight is not an illegal drug but a lawful commercial product. In Plaintiff’s Second Amended Complaint, she alleges that the CBD oil she used was manufactured and labelled under the lawful 0.3 percent standard. Therefore, Plaintiff has alleged that she was she was using a lawful product and that her use of that product was lawful.

Defendants also argue that Plaintiff used a commercial CBD oil that exceeded the state and federal THC standards for industrial hemp products and that use of the higher concentrated THC was unlawful under N.C. Gen. Stat. § 90-94.1. At this stage of the proceedings, the Court must construe Plaintiff’s factual allegations in the light most favorable to her. The Court cannot find from the face of the Second Amended Complaint that Plaintiff purchased and used CBD oil that exceeded the 0.3 percent THC level for industrial hemp. Plaintiff has expressly pled that the label of the product she used stated that it was manufactured under the industrial hemp standard and was a lawful product.

Defendants argue that even if Plaintiff was engaged in the lawful use of a lawful product, her wrongful discharge claim must still be dismissed because her use of CBD oil with detectable levels of THC conflicted with the bona fide occupational requirement of their drug testing policy. The Court disagrees. Defendants’ drug testing policy states that “testing positive for substances that are illegal under state or federal law ... may result in corrective action, up to and including separation from employment.” Plaintiff has alleged that she did not test positive for an illegal substance in violation of that policy, but for the legal substance of CBD oil made from Cannibis sativa L. containing less than 0.3 percent THC by dry weight. Plaintiff has further alleged that the threshold level for a positive THC test under Federal Department of Transportation regulations is 50 ng/dl and that she tested positive for THC at the level of 20 ng/dl.

Accordingly, the undersigned respectfully recommends that Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff’s wrongful termination for use of a lawful product claim be denied.

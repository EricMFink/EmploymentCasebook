### Ehling v. Monmouth-Ocean Hospital Service, Inc. 

#### 872 F.Supp.2d 369 (D.N.J. 2012)

##### WILLIAM J. MARTINI, District Judge.

Plaintiff Deborah Ehling brings this action against Monmouth-Ocean Hospital Service Corp. ("MONOC"), Vincent Robbins, and Stacy Quagliana (collectively "Defendants"), alleging violations of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, the Family Medical Leave Act, and various state laws. This matter comes before the Court on Defendants' motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. For the reasons set forth below, Defendants' Rule 12(b)(6) motion is GRANTED in part, and DENIED in part.

##### I. Background

Plaintiff Deborah Ehling is a registered nurse and paramedic. Defendant Monmouth-Ocean Hospital Service Corporation ("MONOC") is a non-profit hospital service corporation dedicated to providing emergency medical services to the citizens of the State of New Jersey. Defendant Vincent Robbins is the President and CEO of MONOC. Defendant Stacy Quagliana is the Executive Director of Administration at MONOC.

Plaintiff was hired by MONOC in 2004 as a registered nurse and paramedic. In July of 2008, Plaintiff took over as the Acting President of the local union for Professional Emergency Medical Services Association — New Jersey (the "Union"). As President, Plaintiff was "very proactive in attempting to protect the rights and safety of her union members" and filed numerous complaints and charges against MONOC to that end. Plaintiff alleges that, as soon as she became President of the Union, Defendants began engaging in a pattern of retaliatory conduct against her, eventually culminating in her termination in July 2011. Although the Amended Complaint contains allegations regarding a wide range of conduct, the Court will discuss only those allegations that are relevant to the motion to dismiss.

During the 2008-2009 timeframe, Plaintiff maintained an account on Facebook, a social networking website. According to Plaintiff, if someone was not invited to be her Facebook "friend," he or she could not access and view postings on Plaintiff's Facebook "wall." Many of Plaintiff's coworkers were invited to be Plaintiff's Facebook friends. Plaintiff did not invite any members of MONOC management as friends.

Plaintiff alleges that MONOC "\[s\]ubsequently... gained access to Ms. Ehling's Facebook account by having a supervisor(s) summon a MONOC employee, who was also one of Ms. Ehling's Facebook friends, into an office" and "coerc\[ing\], strong-arm\[ing\], and/or threaten\[ing\] the employee into accessing his Facebook account on the work computer in the supervisor's presence." Am. Compl. 20. Plaintiff claims that the supervisor viewed and copied Plaintiff's Facebook postings. One such posting was a comment that Plaintiff made regarding a shooting that took place at the Holocaust Museum in Washington, DC, stating:

> An 88 yr old sociopath white supremacist opened fire in the Wash D.C. Holocaust Museum this morning and killed an innocent guard (leaving children). Other guards opened fire. The 88 yr old was shot. He survived. I blame the DC paramedics. I want to say 2 things to the DC medics. 1. WHAT WERE YOU THINKING? and 2. This was your opportunity to really make a difference! WTF!!!! And to the other guards .... go to target practice.

On June 17, 2009, MONOC sent letters regarding Plaintiff's Facebook posting to the New Jersey Board of Nursing and the New Jersey Department of Health, Office of Emergency Medical Services. The letters state that MONOC was concerned that Plaintiff's Facebook posting showed a disregard for patient safety. Plaintiff alleges that these letters were sent in a "malicious" attempt to attack Plaintiff, damage her reputation and employment opportunities, and potentially risk losing her nursing license and paramedic certification status.

##### III. Discussion

Defendants move to dismiss two of the nine counts in the Amended Complaint: (1) Count II, alleging a violation of the New Jersey Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance Control Act; and (2) Count IV, alleging common law invasion of privacy. Each issue will be addressed in turn.

###### b. Common Law Invasion of Privacy 

Plaintiff asserts a claim for common law invasion of privacy. Plaintiff's claim is premised on Defendants' alleged unauthorized "accessing of her private Facebook postings" regarding the Holocaust Museum shooter. Defendants move to dismiss, arguing that Plaintiff did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in her Facebook posting. The Court finds that the motion to dismiss should be denied.

Under New Jersey law, to state a claim for intrusion upon one's seclusion or private affairs, a plaintiff must allege sufficient facts to demonstrate that (1) her solitude, seclusion, or private affairs were intentionally infringed upon, and that (2) this infringement would highly offend a reasonable person. "\[E\]xpectations of privacy are established by general social norms" and must be objectively reasonable — a plaintiff's subjective belief that something is private is irrelevant. 

Privacy in social networking is an emerging, but underdeveloped, area of case law. There appears to be some consistency in the case law on the two ends of the privacy spectrum. On one end of the spectrum, there are cases holding that there is _no_ reasonable expectation of privacy for material posted to an unprotected website that anyone can view. On the other end of the spectrum, there are cases holding that there _is_ a reasonable expectation of privacy for individual, password-protected online communications. 

Courts, however, have not yet developed a coherent approach to communications falling between these two extremes. Although most courts hold that a communication is not necessarily public just because it is accessible to a number of people, courts differ dramatically in how far they think this theory extends. What is clear is that privacy determinations are made on a case-by-case basis, in light of all the facts presented. 

In this case, Plaintiff argues that she had a reasonable expectation of privacy in her Facebook posting because her comment was disclosed to a limited number of people who she had individually invited to view a restricted access webpage. Defendants argue that Plaintiff cannot have a reasonable expectation of privacy because the comment was disclosed to dozens, if not hundreds, of people. The Amended Complaint and underlying documents do not indicate how many Facebook friends Plaintiff had at the time the comment was made; thus, there is no indication of how many people could permissibly view Plaintiff's posting.

The Court finds that Plaintiff has stated a plausible claim for invasion of privacy, especially given the open-ended nature of the case law. Plaintiff may have had a reasonable expectation that her Facebook posting would remain private, considering that she actively took steps to protect her Facebook page from public viewing. More importantly, however, reasonableness (and offensiveness) are highly fact-sensitive inquiries. As such, these issues are not properly resolved on a motion to dismiss.

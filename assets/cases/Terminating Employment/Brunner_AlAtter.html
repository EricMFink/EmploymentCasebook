        <p>Brunner appeals from a summary judgment for Farouk Al Attar, Rima Al
Attar, and Apollo Paint &amp; Body.</p>
<p>We affirm.</p>
<p>Farouk Al Attar and Rima Al Attar are husband and wife, and partners
in a general partnership, known as Apollo Paint &amp; Body. Brunner
states that Farouk’s actions are the basis of this suit, and that Rima
and Apollo are vicariously liable. Brunner alleged that Farouk
terminated her, because he feared that she would catch and spread the
Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) to employees. Appellees urged
that Brunner was terminated because of her refusal to work during the
hours required, her request to be terminated, and her failure, inability
and/or refusal to perform the work expected of her.</p>
<p>Brunner stated that she had neither contracted AIDS, nor been
infected with the human immunodeficiency virus which causes AIDS.</p>
<p>Appellees moved for summary judgment, alleging that Brunner did not
state a cause of action, and could not amend her pleadings to state a
cause of action.</p>
<p>Brunner testified by deposition that she was terminated from Apollo
Paint &amp; Body because she was a volunteer with the AIDS Foundation.
Brunner had told Farouk that she would be volunteering in her free time
on Saturdays and Sundays, and in the evenings. Brunner promised that her
volunteer work would not interfere with her position at Apollo, and
stated that there was no danger to the employees at Apollo Paint &amp;
Body, because Brunner could not catch AIDS from the patients’ touching,
sneezing, or breathing on her. She further stated that the only way to
catch AIDS is through sexual contact or blood transfusions. Brunner told
Farouk that his customers did not have to know about her volunteer work.
Farouk responded by saying that he could not allow Brunner to perform
volunteer work at the AIDS Foundation and work at Apollo. Farouk told
Brunner that he did not want to place himself, his family, and the
office workers in jeopardy. Farouk urged Brunner to resign, and she
refused.</p>
<p>Rima told another supervisor not to let Farouk fire Brunner. In a
later discussion, Farouk asked Brunner to reconsider, but she would not.
Farouk then said that he would have to fire Brunner.</p>
<p>On February 24, 1989, the trial court granted appellees’ motion for
summary judgment as to the following claims: (i) wrongful termination,
in violation of the public policy of the State of Texas; [ * * * ]. The
trial court ordered that Brunner’s pleadings be stricken as to those
claims, as well as her claim for damages. [ * * * ]</p>
<p>In her first point of error, Brunner asserts that this Court should
not permit her to be terminated for performing volunteer work for the
AIDS Foundation because her termination violates the public policy
exception to the employment-at-will doctrine.</p>
<p>Brunner does not allege that her employment was governed by a
contract, or that it was for a definite term. The general rule is that
employment for an indefinite term may be terminated at will and without
cause. [T]he Texas Supreme Court [has] recognized a very narrow
exception to the judicially-created employment-at-will doctrine. “That
narrow exception covers only the discharge of an employee for the sole
reason that the employee refused to perform an illegal act.” The supreme
court stated that where an employee sought to invoke the public policy
exception, “it is the plaintiff’s burden to prove by a preponderance of
the evidence that his discharge was for no reason other than his refusal
to perform an illegal act.” [ * * * ]</p>
<p>Brunner alleges that she was fired because she refused to quit her
volunteer work with the AIDS Foundation; however, she has not alleged
that she was terminated for refusing to perform an illegal act [ * * *
]. Brunner has failed to allege sufficient facts to place her within
[that] exception[] to the employment-at-will doctrine. This Court cannot
create another exception for performing volunteer work at the Houston
AIDS Foundation. If such an exception is to be created, that is a matter
within the province of the Texas Supreme Court.</p>
<p>[ * * * ]</p>
<p>The judgment is affirmed.</p>

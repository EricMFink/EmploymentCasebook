        <p>This is an appeal from the dismissal of a wrongful termination case.
Beatrice Amador, Appellant, alleged she was terminated from her
employment due to her discussion of the issue of abortion, among other
theories, to which Ian Frederick Tan and General Mills, Inc., Appellees,
filed special exceptions. The court sustained Appellees’ special
exceptions, and upon Appellant’s failure to amend her pleadings,
dismissed the case. In her sole point of error, Appellant complains the
trial court erred in holding that she failed to state a cause of action
on any of her four theories. We affirm the judgment of the trial
court.</p>
<section id="i.-summary-of-the-evidence" class="level1">
<h1>I. Summary of the Evidence</h1>
<p>The Appellant, Beatrice Amador, was employed as a waitress at the Red
Lobster Restaurant in El Paso, Texas from August 31, 1981 to March 30,
1990. During that period of time, Appellee, Ian Frederick Tan (“Tan”),
was the manager of the restaurant. The record in the instant case shows
that it is uncontroverted that Appellant’s status with Red Lobster
Restaurant was nothing more than an at-will employee, employed without
the benefit of a written contract.</p>
<p>Appellant alleges that she was terminated in retaliation for actions
taken by her relating to two “on-the-job” incidents. As a result of the
first incident, Appellant sought the assistance of the corporate
headquarters of Appellee, General Mills, Inc. This first action by
Appellant required her to go “over the head” of Tan, and resulted in a
subsequent investigation. Appellant alleges that this investigation by
corporate headquarters formed the basis for Tan’s dislike of her and his
subsequent attempts to devise ways to terminate her from her
employment.</p>
<p>The second incident involved Tan and another waitress employed by Red
Lobster whom Appellant had befriended in 1985. The record shows that
Appellant and the other waitress shared close personal confidences and
in June of 1989, the other waitress informed Appellant that she had
engaged in a sexual relationship with Tan, and as a result, had become
pregnant with his child. Appellant contends that despite Tan’s pressures
to the contrary, she repeatedly counseled the waitress not to have an
abortion. Appellant alleges that this advice to the other waitress
further intensified Tan’s animosity toward her, and was a contributing
factor in her eventual termination from employment.</p>
<p>Appellant brought claims for the public policy tort of suppression of
an employee’s discussion of the issue of abortion, breach of contract,
breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and
intentional infliction of emotional distress. Tan and General Mills,
Inc. filed special exceptions, excepting in part, to Appellant’s failure
to state a cause of action. The trial court found that Plaintiff’s First
Amended Original Petition failed to state causes of action upon which
relief could be granted. When Appellant failed to amend her pleadings,
the trial court sustained Appellees <a href="#p133">133</a><a href="#p133">*133</a> special exceptions and dismissed her causes of
action.</p>

<section id="ii.-discussion" class="level1">
<h1>II. Discussion</h1>
<p>In her sole point of error, Appellant urges it was error for the
court to find that she failed to state a cause of action on any of her
four alleged theories.</p>
<p>[ * * * ]</p>
<section id="b.-public-policy-tort-of-suppression-of-an-employees-discussion-of-the-issue-of-abortion-and-breach-of-contract" class="level2">
<h2>B. Public Policy Tort of Suppression of an Employee’s Discussion of
the Issue of Abortion and Breach of Contract</h2>
<p>Appellant alleged that her termination from employment was in
retaliation for her actions in counseling a fellow waitress, who was
pregnant with the manager’s child, not to have an abortion and further
in retaliation for complaining to her manager’s corporate superiors.
Appellant argues that the termination by Appellees amounted to the
unlawful suppression of her discussion regarding the issue of abortion
as well as a breach of an implied promise not to retaliate.</p>
<p>It is well established in Texas, that employment for an indefinite
period is terminable at will. The Supreme Court has carved out only one
exception to the general rule allowing a cause action for wrongful
termination when the employee has been discharged for the sole reason
that the employee has refused to perform an illegal act. Numerous other
restrictions and exceptions to at-will doctrine have been created by the
legislature.</p>
<p>We have reviewed Appellant’s pleadings and find that she has wholly
failed to plead any of the recognized exceptions to the general rule of
at-will employment. To the contrary, Appellant seeks to have this Court
create additional exceptions and establish a “public policy tort” of
suppression of an employee’s discussion of the issue of abortion, as
well as a cause of action for breach of an implied promise not to
retaliate against her for reporting her manager to his superiors. [ * *
* ] In <em>Winters,</em> on facts far more compelling than those found
in the instant case, the [Texas] Supreme Court declined to recognize “a
cause of action for private employees who are discharged for reporting
illegal activities.” We elect to follow the reasoning of
<em>Winters,</em> and find that there is no recognized cause of action
in Texas for a private, at-will employee who has been terminated as a
result of his or her discussions regarding the issue of abortion.
<em>See</em> <em>Brunner v. Al Attar,</em> 786 S.W.2d 784, 786 (Tex.App.
1990) (refusal to create an exception to at-will doctrine where employee
was terminated upon her refusal to quit her volunteer work with the AIDS
Foundation). Likewise, we find there is no recognized cognizable claim
under Texas law which would confer a cause of action upon a private,
at-will employee who has been terminated for breach of an implied
promise not to retaliate for having reported his or her manager to
superiors. Accordingly, we find that under current Texas law, Appellant
has failed to state a cause of action for violation of the “public
policy tort” as described above, or for breach of contract.</p>

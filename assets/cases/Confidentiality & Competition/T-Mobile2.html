<h4>Decision and Order</h4>
<p>  [ * * * ]</p>
<p>The consolidated complaint alleges that numerous provisions in
written work rules and policies applicable to the Respondent’s employees
are unlawful. An employer violates Section 8(a)(1) of the Act if it
maintains workplace rules that would reasonably tend to chill employees
in the exercise of their Section 7 rights. The analytical framework for
assessing whether maintenance of rules violates the Act is set forth in
<em>Lutheran Heritage Village-Livonia</em>, 343 NLRB 646 (2004). Under
<em>Lutheran Heritage</em>, a work rule is unlawful if “the rule
explicitly restricts activities protected by Section 7.” If the work
rule does not explicitly restrict protected activities, it nonetheless
will violate Section 8(a)(1) if “(1) employees would reasonably construe
the language to prohibit Section 7 activity; (2) the rule was
promulgated in response to union activity; or (3) the rule has been
applied to restrict the exercise of Section 7 rights.”   The rules at
issue before us are not alleged to explicitly restrict protected
activities or to have been promulgated in response to or applied to
restrict Section 7 activities. Thus, the relevant inquiry is whether
employees would reasonably construe the challenged rules to prohibit
Section 7 activity. In construing rules, Lutheran Heritage teaches that
they are to be given a reasonable reading, and are not to be considered
in isolation. Further, any ambiguity in the rule must be construed
against the drafter–here, the Respondent.   [ * * * ]   [W]e find that
the Respondent [ … ] violated Section 8(a)(1) by promulgating and
maintaining rules in its employee handbook [ … ] prohibiting employees
from making recordings in the workplace.   [ * * * ]</p>
<p>[S]ince at least January 16, 2014, the Respondent promulgated and has
maintained the following handbook rule prohibiting employees from making
recordings in the workplace:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To prevent harassment, maintain individual privacy, encourage open
communication, and protect confidential information employees are
prohibited from recording people or confidential information using
cameras, camera phones/devices, or recording devices (audio or video) in
the workplace. Apart from customer calls that are recorded for quality
purposes, employees may not tape or otherwise make sound recordings of
work-related or workplace discussions. Exceptions may be granted when
participating in an authorized TMUS activity or with permission from an
employee’s Manager, HR Business Partner, or the Legal Department. If an
exception is granted, employees may not take a picture, audiotape, or
videotape others in the workplace without the prior notification of all
participants.   The General Counsel alleged that the rule violates
Section 8(a)(1) because it unlawfully restricts employees from using
cameras and audio and recording devices in the workplace to assist in,
support, and get evidence of protected concerted activity. In
recommending dismissal, the judge stated that the Board had not
previously found a Section 7 right to record in the workplace. The judge
also found that the Respondent had set forth valid, nondiscriminatory
rationales for the rule, including maintaining a harassment-free work
environment and protecting trade secrets, and that the rule was narrowly
tailored to these interests. For the following reasons, we reverse the
[ALJ] and find the violation.   After the [ALJ’s] decision issued, the
Board issued decisions in <em>Rio All-Suites Hotel &amp; Casino</em>,
362 NLRB No. 190 (2015), and <em>Whole Foods Market</em>, 363 NLRB
No. 87 (2015), finding that employer rules broadly prohibiting recording
in the workplace on employees’ own time and in nonwork areas restricted
Section 7 activity in violation of Section 8(a)(1) of the Act. As the
Board explained in those decisions, photography and audio or video
recording in the workplace, as well as the posting of photographs and
recordings on social media, may be protected by Section 7 if employees
are acting in concert for their mutual aid and protection and no
overriding employer interest is present. Such protected conduct may
include, for example, recording images of protected picketing,
documenting unsafe workplace equipment or hazardous working conditions,
documenting and publicizing discussions about terms and conditions of
employment, documenting inconsistent application of employer rules, or
recording evidence to preserve it for later use in administrative or
judicial forums in employment-related actions.   The rule at issue here
bans employees from recording “people or confidential information using
cameras, camera phones/devices, or recording devices (audio or video) in
the workplace” and, except for calls that the Respondent records for
quality purposes, prohibits employees from making “sound recordings of
work-related or workplace discussions.” The rule does not differentiate
between recordings that are protected by Section 7 and those that are
not, and includes in its prohibition recordings made during nonwork time
and in nonwork areas. The Respondent does not deny that the rule
prohibits all recording and makes no exception for protected concerted
activity. Accordingly, because of the rule’s broad language, employees
would reasonably read the rule to prohibit recording that would be
protected by Section 7 of the Act.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-0" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-0" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">(n.11 in Decision) In addition, the Respondent’s
maintenance of the rule unlawfully requires employees to obtain the
Respondent’s permission before engaging in recording activity on nonwork
time. The Board has stated that any rule that requires employees to
obtain an employer’s permission before engaging in protected concerted
activity on an employee’s free time and in nonwork areas is
unlawful.<br>
<br>
</span></span>   The Respondent contends that the recording restriction
is justified by its general interest in maintaining employee privacy,
protecting confidential information, and promoting open communication.
That the Respondent’s proffered intent is not aimed at restricting
Section 7 activity does not cure the rule’s overbreadth, as neither the
rule nor the proffered justifications are narrowly tailored to protect
legitimate employer interests or to reasonably exclude Section 7
activity from the reach of the prohibition. As for protecting
““confidential information,” the Respondent has not excepted to the
judge’s findings that it unlawfully maintained other rules classifying
employee information, including employee contact information and wage
and salary information, as confidential. The Respondent also asserts
that its recording prohibition is in place to prevent harassment and
notes that, under federal and state laws, employers have an affirmative
obligation to prevent harassing conduct. But the recording prohibition
is not narrowly tailored to this interest; it neither cites laws
regarding workplace harassment nor specifies that the restriction is
limited to recordings that could constitute unlawful harassment.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">(n.12 in Decision) The Respondent also argues that
nonconsensual recording is unlawful in many of the states in which it
operates. The Respondent’s rule, however, is not limited to these
states. Moreover, the rule does not refer to these laws or indicate that
the restriction is limited to recordings that do not comply with state
laws.”<br>
<br>
</span></span> Thus, the Respondent’s proffered rationales cannot
justify the rule’s broad restriction that employees would reasonably
read as prohibiting activity protected by Section 7. See <em>Whole
Foods</em> (finding employer’s interests in preserving employee privacy,
protecting confidential information, and encouraging open communication
insufficient to justify broad and unqualified prohibition on
recording).<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">(n.13 in Decision) In contrast, in <em>Flagstaff
Medical Center</em>, the Board found restrictions on workplace recording
to be lawful because the restrictions reasonably conveyed that they
concerned the hospital’s obligation to protect patient privacy interests
and prevent wrongful disclosure of individually identifiable health
information. No such concerns are present here.<br>
<br>
</span></span>   Accordingly, we find that employees would reasonably
construe the rule to restrict activity protected by Section 7 of the
Act, and that the Respondent’s promulgation and maintenance of the rule
violates Section 8(a)(1) of the Act as alleged.</p>

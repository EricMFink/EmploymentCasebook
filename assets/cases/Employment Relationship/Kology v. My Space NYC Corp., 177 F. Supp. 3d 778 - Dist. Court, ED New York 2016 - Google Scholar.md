### Kology v. MySpace NYC Corp.

#### 177 F. Supp. 3d 778 (E.D.N.Y. 1984)

##### GLASSER, Senior United States District Judge.

Dena Kology brought suit under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII), New York State Human Rights Law (NYSHRL), and New York City Human Rights Law (NYCHRL), against My Space NYC Corp. ("My Space") and its president, Guy Hochman (collectively, "Defendants"). Arguing that My Space was not Kology's employer and therefore cannot be held liable under the employment discrimination statutes, Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1). But the existence of an employee-employer relationship is not a jurisdictional matter; it is a substantive element of Kology's claims. Defendants' motion therefore should be construed as a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. Because both parties have filed affidavits demonstrating that My Space was Kology's employer, however, the Court converts Defendants' motion to dismiss to a motion for summary judgment. The motion is DENIED.

##### 1 BACKGROUND

From May 2009 to August 2014, Kology was an agent and manager at My Space, a real estate brokerage. Hochman, My Space's president, hired her and assigned her general duties — _e.g.,_ opening and closing the office, meeting tenants and landlords, attending staff meetings, training and evaluating agents, and compiling reports — and at times more specific duties; he controlled "every aspect of how" she completed her work. Hochman also controlled Kology's schedule, requiring his approval for time-off. 

In 2010, after Hochman tasked Kology with managing a new branch office, Kology signed a contract detailing her salary, commission, holidays, vacation, and sick leave. Kology later signed a non-compete agreement. 

In 2011, Kology formed Atlantis 94 Corp. ("Atlantis"), a corporation of which she was the sole shareholder and employee. My Space thereafter paid Atlantis for Kology's services. This was Atlantis's only purpose. Although Defendants maintain that Atlantis was a "vendor" of My Space, the parties appear to agree that this arrangement did not affect Kology's duties or Hochman's control over her at work. Hochman later named Kology Senior Vice President of My Space, and ordered her to list that title in emails and on her business card.

Kology alleges violations of Title VII and state law occurring between July 2013 and August 15, 2014. On that day, Hochman fired her.

##### 2 LEGAL STANDARD

Although Defendants bring their motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1), a defendant's "status as Plaintiff's employer is a nonjurisdictional element of her substantive cause of action, and therefore, a Rule 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is not the appropriate procedural vehicle for presenting this defense." Defendants' motion should be construed as a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.

The affidavits filed by the parties cannot be considered on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, however, so the Court will convert the motion to one for summary judgment. And because both parties have had "a reasonable opportunity to present" all pertinent material, the Court will decide the summary judgment motion on the present submissions.

##### 3 DISCUSSION

Defendants argue that My Space was not Kology's employer simply because My Space paid Kology's corporation, Atlantis, rather than Kology. This argument borders on frivolous. The "corporate form under which a plaintiff does business is not dispositive in the determination of whether an individual is an employee." Yet evidence of corporate form is the _only_ evidence cited by Defendants to support their contention that My Space was not Kology's employer. The remaining evidence — facts asserted in Kology's affidavit that are not disputed in Hochman's affidavit or reply affidavit — clearly demonstrates that My Space was Kology's employer for the duration of their relationship.

Under Title VII, courts construe "the term 'employer' functionally, to encompass persons who are not employers in conventional terms, but who nevertheless control some aspect of an employee's compensation or terms, conditions, or privileges of employment." "'[T]he absence of a direct employment relationship does not bar a Title VII claim, and [ ] liability extends beyond conventional, single-employer situations.'" For example, "'an employee, formally employed by one entity, who has been assigned to work in circumstances that justify the conclusion that the employee is at the same time constructively employed by another entity, may impose liability... on the constructive employer, on the theory that this other entity is the employee's joint employer.'" 

These principles compel the conclusion that My Space was Kology's employer (or, technically, joint employer) and therefore subject to liability under Title VII, the NYSHRL, and the NYCHRL. No one disputes that My Space was Kology's employer when it hired her — Hochman, among other things, set her schedule and responsibilities, and controlled "how" she carried them out — and that Atlantis's formation two years later did not alter the functional features of this relationship. The formation of Atlantis — an entity whose sole purpose was to receive Kology's compensation — was a change in form, not substance; it does not immunize My Space from liability under the employment discrimination laws. 

Defendants' motion is DENIED.

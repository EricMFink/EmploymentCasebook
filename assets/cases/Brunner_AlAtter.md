Brunner appeals from a summary judgment for Farouk Al Attar, Rima Al Attar, and Apollo Paint & Body.

We affirm.

Farouk Al Attar and Rima Al Attar are husband and wife, and partners in a general partnership, known as Apollo Paint & Body. Brunner states that Farouk's actions are the basis of this suit, and that Rima and Apollo are vicariously liable. Brunner alleged that Farouk terminated her, because he feared that she would catch and spread the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) to employees. Appellees urged that Brunner was terminated because of her refusal to work during the hours required, her request to be terminated, and her failure, inability and/or refusal to perform the work expected of her.

Brunner stated that she had neither contracted AIDS, nor been infected with the human immunodeficiency virus which causes AIDS.

Appellees moved for summary judgment, alleging that Brunner did not state a cause of action, and could not amend her pleadings to state a cause of action.

Brunner testified by deposition that she was terminated from Apollo Paint & Body because she was a volunteer with the AIDS Foundation. Brunner had told Farouk that she would be volunteering in her free time on Saturdays and Sundays, and in the evenings. Brunner promised that her volunteer work would not interfere with her position at Apollo, and stated that there was no danger to the employees at Apollo Paint & Body, because Brunner could not catch AIDS from the patients' touching, sneezing, or breathing on her. She further stated that the only way to catch AIDS is through sexual contact or blood transfusions. Brunner told Farouk that his customers did not have to know about her volunteer work. Farouk responded by saying that he could not allow Brunner to perform volunteer work at the AIDS Foundation and work at Apollo. Farouk told Brunner that he did not want to place himself, his family, and the office workers in jeopardy. Farouk urged Brunner to resign, and she refused.

Rima told another supervisor not to let Farouk fire Brunner. In a later discussion, Farouk asked Brunner to reconsider, but she would not. Farouk then said that he would have to fire Brunner.

On February 24, 1989, the trial court granted appellees' motion for summary judgment as to the following claims: (i) wrongful termination, in violation of the public policy of the State of Texas; [ * * * ]. The trial court ordered that Brunner's pleadings be stricken as to those claims, as well as her claim for damages. [ * * * ]

In her first point of error, Brunner asserts that this Court should not permit her to be terminated for performing volunteer work for the AIDS Foundation because her termination violates the public policy exception to the employment-at-will doctrine.

Brunner does not allege that her employment was governed by a contract, or that it was for a definite term. The general rule is that employment for an indefinite term may be terminated at will and without cause. [T]he Texas Supreme Court [has] recognized a very narrow exception to the judicially-created employment-at-will doctrine. "That narrow exception covers only the discharge of an employee for the sole reason that the employee refused to perform an illegal act." The supreme court stated that where an employee sought to invoke the public policy exception, "it is the plaintiff's burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that his discharge was for no reason other than his refusal to perform an illegal act." [ * * * ]

Brunner alleges that she was fired because she refused to quit her volunteer work with the AIDS Foundation; however, she has not alleged that she was terminated for refusing to perform an illegal act [ * * * ]. Brunner has failed to allege sufficient facts to place her within [that] exception[] to the employment-at-will doctrine. This Court cannot create another exception for performing volunteer work at the Houston AIDS Foundation. If such an exception is to be created, that is a matter within the province of the Texas Supreme Court.

[ * * * ]

The judgment is affirmed.
